This repository contains Jupyter Notebook code for predicting stock prices of QQQ, NVDA, and AAPL using LSTM models. The code includes data visualization to analyze the results.The LSTM models are trained on historical stock price data from 2015-01-01 until 2023-04-01,and the predictions are made on the basis of that data.
